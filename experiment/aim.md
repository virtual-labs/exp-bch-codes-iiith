### Aim of the experiment
The aim of this experiment is to introduce students with the concepts of Bose-Chaudhuri-Hocquenghem codes (BCH codes). These codes form a class of cyclic error-correcting codes that are constructed using polynomials over a finite field (Galois field). In this experiment, our focus will be on the encoding and decoding of binary BCH codes.

Firstly, we will provide a generator polynomial associated with the $t-$error-correcting binary BCH code. Next, we will see the decoding of $t$-error-correcting BCH code by identifying the syndrome components of the received polynomial. Particularly, in this experiment, we will discuss Berlekamp's iterative algorithm to identify the errors in the given received vector.

The structure of the experiment is as follows:
  * Construction of generator polynomial for binary BCH codes
  * Berlekamp's iterative algorithm
